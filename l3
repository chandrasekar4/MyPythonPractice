While Dhoni was studying in Class VII that football's loss became cricket's gain. It was only due to the regular wicket-keeper being unavailable, that his sports teacher KR Banerjee asked Dhoni to try his hand at wicket-keeping.

When Dhoni donned his keeper's gloves for the first time, he found it a bit challenging to adapt to the wicket-keeping saves. Banerjee threw infinite number of balls to make Dhoni recognise the right strategy to catch the ball instead of punching it. Dhoni missed a lot of balls in the beginning but picked up fairly later.

Write a program to find the number throws required to achieve "n" catches. There are infinite throws, so break the input when the number of "True"s equals "n".

Input Format:
First line of the input contains an integer that specifies the number of catches "n".
Next "n" lines contains a boolean value that specifies "True" if every throw was a catch or "False" if it was a miss.

Output Format:
Output should display an integer that returns the number of throws required for achieving "n" catches by Dhoni.

Sample Input:
5
True
False
False
True
False
True
False
False
True
False
True

Sample Output:
11

solution:
n=int(input())
a=0
i=0
while(i<n):
    catch=input()
    a+=1
    if catch=="True":
        i+=1
print(a)
