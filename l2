Dhoni had put up great efforts and determination to perfect the art of wicket-keeping that he practiced day in and out even during freezing winter. He strived hard continuously for 18 months and played his first game for the Commando cricket club.

Every throw from a bowler is either missed or blocked or caught by the keeper Dhoni. Given "n" throws and the outcome of it (misses/blocks/catches), write a program that finds the number of missed deliveries, number of blocked deliveries and number of caught deliveries.

Input Format:
First line of the input is an integer that specifies the number of throws "n" of a bowler.
Next "n" lines contains a string that specifies the outcome of each of the throws - 'M' for misses/'B' for blocks/'C' for catches.

Output Format:
Output should display 3 integers that returns the count of missed, blocked and caught deliveries by Dhoni.

Sample Input:
9
M
C
C

M

B

Sample Output:
4

3

solution:
n=int(input())
missed=0
blocked=0
catch=0
for i in range(n):
    ball=input()
    if(ball=='M'):
        missed+=1
    elif(ball=='B'):
        blocked+=1
    elif(ball=='C'):
        catch+=1
print(missed,blocked,catch)
