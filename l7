Dhoni made his 'Ranji Trophy debut for Bihar in the 1999-2000 season as an eighteen-year-old. He made a half century in his debut match scoring 68" in the second innings against Assam cricket team.

For the purpose of gathering statistics about the match, let us consider Assam put up a target of "x" runs for Bihar to chase. If the runs scored in each and every ball by the Bihar team is given, write a program to calculate the number of overs did Bihar take to win the match.

The input, to get the runs scored in each and every ball, should break, when the target runs are reached.

Input Format:
First line of the input is an integer "X" that specifies the target runs set for the Bihar team.
Next consecutive lines contain the integer that specifies the runs scored in each ball of the Bihar innings.

Output Format:
Output should display the integer values that represents the number of overs and balls required to win the match, in separate lines.

Sample Input:
15
2
4
1
2
1
1
1
6

Sample Output:
1
2
solution:
target=int(input())
runs=0
balls=0
while runs<target:
    ballrun=int(input())
    runs+=ballrun
    balls+=1
overs=balls//6
ball=balls%6
print(overs)
print(ball)
