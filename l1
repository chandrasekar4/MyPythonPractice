Dhoni himself revealed that Football was his first love and he was more inclined towards football since a school boy. Christiano Ronaldo being his favorite player among the English Clubs, Dhoni was so impressive with his saves as a goal keeper for his school football team.

Imagine the scale of the goal post is from 1 to 10. Dhoni, the goal keeper, stands at the mid point 5. Those kicks that are saved between the points 1 and 2 are likely to be a left corner save and those that are saved between the points 9 and 10 are likely to be a right corner save.

Write a program that finds the number of corer saves given the point at which each kick hits the goal post.

Input Format:
First line of the input is an integer that speficies the number of kicks.
Second line is an integer that specifies the point at which the kick hits the goal post.

Output Format:
Output displays the integer that specifies the number of corner saves that is likely to be.

Sample Input 1:

solution:
count=0
n=int(input())
for i in range(n):
    y=int(input())
    if(y<=2 or y>=9):
        count+=1
print(count)
