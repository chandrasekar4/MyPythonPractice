Itâ€™s your job to calculate the cost of replacing damaged battle droids and to check whether it is within the budget limit of Rs.15000. The cost of the equipment and parts is given below.

Blast Rifle                                 Rs.350.34

Visual Sensors                          Rs.230.90

Auditory Sensors                      Rs.190.55

Arms                                         Rs.125.30

Legs                                          Rs.180.90

Write a program to solve this problem.

Input format:

Input consists of 5 integers

The first input denotes the number of blast rifles needed

The second input denotes the number of visual sensors needed

The third input denotes the number of auditory sensors needed

The fourth input denotes the number of arms needed

The fifth input denotes the number of legs needed

Output format:

If the total cost of replacing damaged battle droids is within the sanctioned budget of Rs. 15000, print "Yes". Otherwise, print "No"

Refer the sample output for formatting

s5=180.90
br=(x*s1)
vs=(y*s2)
As=(z*s3)
ar=(a*s4)
leg=(b*s5)
if((br+vs+As+ar+leg)<=15000):
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
